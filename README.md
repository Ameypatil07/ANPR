# Automatic Number Plate Detection

This repository contains code for ANPR using machine learning models.

Dataset
To train the deepfake detection model, you need to download the dataset. You can find the dataset [url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection).

Preprocessing
Before training the model, it is necessary to preprocess the videos. 

Model Training
After preprocessing the dataset, you can train the ANPR model.

Prediction
Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the authenticity of photos.

Streamlit Web App
To run the Streamlit web app, execute the following command:
streamlit app run.py
